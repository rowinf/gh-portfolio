Turning a html table into a csv is an interesting problem because  html parsing and csv formatting can both be very challenging.

The command line is a good approach because it is flexible enough to handle many different cases. The tools I ended up using seem powerful, so attempting this will level up your command line skills. This solution is highly flexible and powerful, but we pay the price for that power and flexibility by having to learn something.

Since we're going with a pure command line, we start with either `$ curl http://web.site` or `$ cat file`.

[pup](https://github.com/ericchiang/pup) seemed like a part of the solution. It offers general purpose html parsing/selecting. The command I used was `$ pup 'table td text{}'` to get the text from each table cell. You can see this [more detailed explanation](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/589798/html-parsing-with-pup) for using pup

`awk` is the next tool I used after unsuccessfully trying xargs, sed, and paste. What eventually worked was this: `$ awk '{printf "%s%s", (NR%3 == 1 ? "" : ", "), $0} NR % 3 == 0 {print ""}'`

putting it all together you get:

    cat test.html |
    pup 'table td text{}' |
    awk '{printf "%s%s", (NR%3 == 1 ? "" : ", "), $0} NR % 3 == 0 {print ""}'
