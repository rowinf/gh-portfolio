This is a contest entry to Stats NZ for data visualisation of transport commuter data back in 2020. It uses Mapbox and React to display commuter travel habits. The data included where they generally travel for work, from where, and what mode of transport they use.

The project was part of a larger government program of "mode shift" to encourage people to use alternative modes of transport. I won honorable mention for the parallel axis chart that revealed an important insight in the commuter data. The chart revealed where alternative modes of transport were being used the most.
