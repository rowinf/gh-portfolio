title: Static vs Dynamically Typed Languages

Types or no types

JSDoc suggests that concepts are not fixed, they are subject to unbundling.

I think of types as another kind of documentation

It sometimes leads to ugly code. Poets may not like them.

Beauty is a noble ideal.

Friction is a source of frustration in programming.

Friction reduces joy. A lack of documentation or types can increase friction.

Some programming tools reduce friction. I'm a fan of those tools. Tailwind is one. Vim is another. Statically typed languages can be too.

My view is that it depends on the language. A type system can reduce friction, or it can add friction.

Typescript allows flexibility in types. It takes foresight to write appropriately flexible types. Developers easily fall into the habit of writing the most literal types, which also happen to be the most restrictive types.

I favour less restrictive type systems.
