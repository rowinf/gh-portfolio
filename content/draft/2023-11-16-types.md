title: Static vs Dynamically Typed Languages

Do I prefer types or no types.

I see types as another form of documentation

It sometimes leads to ugly, overspecified, inflexible code. I have occasionally wished that I didn't have to specify which type to use because the nested GraphQL data type was I worked with was very complex.

Beauty is a noble ideal. Beauty is nice to be around. Beauty is motivating. A spiritual plugin to what we are working on.

Friction is a source of frustration in programming.

Friction reduces joy. A lack of documentation or types can increase friction.

A type system can reduce friction, or it can add friction.

The existence of some type systems like JSDoc suggest that types don't need to be all or nothing, they can be added a piece at a time where needed. This is the friendliest way to introduce types.

Conventional wisdom suggests Beauty does not matter at all here, if it even exists. Maybe it's even offensive to suggest that some code can be beautiful while other code is not. But Maybe COBOL died from ugliness. Maybe C and SQL are dying from ugliness. The next generation doesn't feel compelled to take responsibility for its survival, in fact they want to replace these languages.
