title: Static vs Dynamically Typed Languages

Do I prefer types or no types.

I see types as another form of documentation

It sometimes leads to ugly code. Poets may not like them.

Beauty is a noble ideal. Beauty is nice to be around. Nice code is nice to work on.

I'd rather work on nice code than not nice code. Nice code as a motivation for carrying on. A spiritual enhancement to what we are working on. No one likes ugliness. This goes back to the notion that beauty is a necessary condition for human flourishing.

Friction is a source of frustration in programming. Ugliness can be another.

Friction reduces joy. A lack of documentation or types can increase friction.

Seen purely through utilitarian values, beauty does not matter at all here, like what is beauty even, this thing probably doesn't exist. There's no higher virtue for code, anything beyond what works is superfluous and probably even detrimental. I mean, maybe it's offensive to suggest that some code can be ugly, like get over yourself.

Some programming tools reduce friction. I'm a fan of those tools. Tailwind is one. Vim is another. Statically typed languages can be too.

My view is that it depends on the language. A type system can reduce friction, or it can add friction.

Typescript allows flexibility in types. It takes foresight to write appropriately flexible types. Developers easily fall into the habit of writing the most literal types, which also happen to be the most restrictive types.

JSDoc suggests that concepts are not all or nothing, they are subject to unbundling.

I favour less restrictive type systems.
