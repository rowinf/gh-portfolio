Grug see many team fall to complexity demon. Grug now risk overcorrection by steering clear of any complexity. Grug reaches for club whenever JavaScript mentioned. Grug then calms self, world different now, things simpler. Complexity demon in full retreat, maybe banished into other world, but maybe waiting to return.

Grug not sure about tailwind for many years, but maybe come around to it. Utility classes have uses. Grug not sure about much of it. Grug still think buttons and links not need 30 classes.

Grug steer clear of react, but still know it industry common for long time and many time from now. This grug went to react in need of shiny coin, and many young grugs follow in this grug's footsteps.
