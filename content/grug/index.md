This is a tribute to [Grug Brain](https://grugbrain.dev/)

Grug see many team fall to complexity demon. Grug now risk overcorrection by steering clear of any complexity. Grug reaches for club whenever JavaScript mentioned. Grug then calms self, world different now, things simpler. Complexity demon in full retreat, maybe banished into other world, but maybe waiting to return.

Grug not sure about tailwind for many years, but maybe come around to it. Utility classes have uses. Grug not sure about much of it. Grug still think buttons and links not need 30 css classes.

Grug use react for many years, but steer clear of latest react 19. Grug still know it common in industry for long time and still be common many year from now. This grug went to react in need of shiny coin, and many young grugs follow in this grug's footsteps. Grug see React promises turn to lies and Grug not alone.

Grug knows safety in numbers. Staying with tribe good way to keep complexity demon away. Even when he come by, other grugs help in fighting back. Many grugs feel straying from tribe invites complexity demon. Grug understand, and feel like old ways were better at fighting complexity demon.
