Art changed so much around the turn of the 20th century. I chose some images from myths found on [oldbookillustrations.com](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/) to compare with one another. really see them become more "modern" even as the myths are all from long ago.

Perseus stands on a rocky shoreline, still wielding his sword as he holds Medusa's severed head in his arms. The two surviving gorgons crawl the ground, seemingly stricken with terror while Medusa's headless body lies in the forefront. [1890s](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/perseus-gorgons/)

A young man plays the flute in the foreground, while three couples are dancing to the music in a landscape with mountains overlooking a stretch of water. One of the couples consists of a young woman and a satyr, another of a young woman and a tree, and the third of two dogs. [1900s](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/orpheus/)

A woman wearing a crown stands as though waving at swans flocking around her. This picture is an illustration for the tale, "The Six Swans." [1910s](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/changed-into-swans/)

Jason, dressed as a hoplite, points his finger toward the Golden Fleece glowing in the distance while Medea stands at his side at the entrance of Adelphi. [1920s](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/jason-asked/)
