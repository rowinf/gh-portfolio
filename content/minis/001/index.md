Art changed so much around the turn of the 20th century. I chose some images from myths found on [oldbookillustrations.com](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/) to compare with one another. really see them become more "modern" even as the myths are all from long ago.

[1890s](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/perseus-gorgons/)
{{< figure src="perseus-gorgons-768.jpg" title="Perseus stands on a rocky shoreline, still wielding his sword as he holds Medusa's severed head in his arms. The two surviving gorgons crawl the ground, seemingly stricken with terror while Medusa's headless body lies in the forefront." link="perseus-gorgons-768.jpg" data-pswp-width="250" data-pswp-height="768" >}}

{{< figure src="orpheus-768.jpg" title="A young man plays the flute in the foreground, while three couples are dancing to the music in a landscape with mountains overlooking a stretch of water. One of the couples consists of a young woman and a satyr, another of a young woman and a tree, and the third of two dogs." link="https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/orpheus/" data-pswp-width="250" data-pswp-height="768" >}}
