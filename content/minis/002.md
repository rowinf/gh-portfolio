A Visual guide to exiting the javascript ecosystem

Become frustrated by the seeming slowness of things. The deceptive productivity. First, everything feels fast, but one notices that despite moving fast, no ground is gained, little value delivered for the amount of busyness in JS.

Find hypermedia systems! 

Spend a year assembling critiquest of React, and the insane JavaScript ecosystem in general.

Find a whole heap of options going forward. Is htmx the way out? maybe turbo, or web components?

I'm still reeling from this. I'm still looking for my way forward.
