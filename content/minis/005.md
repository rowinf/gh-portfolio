Why is it that we are able to defer our dreams and ideas.

Most ideas stay up in imagination land, unrealized. Nearly all ideas are bad and belong there, but some are good and stay there anyway. Some are good and become realized, they find their way into the real world. They are enacted through people. 

An office worker can have many dreams, yet stays in place. Maybe they're waiting for something. Morpheus to come pull them out of the simulation?

Luxury beliefs. The capitalist enjoyer who hopes one day for a communist revolution, half heartedly. Maybe he just wants health care and they call him a communist for it, but becomes an actual communist out of spite.

A office worker that wants to run their own business, reads about it every day. Never acts. Too risky.
