Hugo is a static site generator written in the Go programming language.

This blog is written with Hugo with the theme PaperMod.

Hugo is fast, I know Go. I like how fast and simple Go is. Performance is on everyone's mind these days. 

One blog I read told a story of how they implemented their blog in Go. Even though that blog is much larger, I'm an aspirational developer. Maybe one day my blog could be as large!
