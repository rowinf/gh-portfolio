Some free reading material I've found over the years I've found inspiring on my web developer journey.

[Resilient web design](https://resilientwebdesign.com/) is a story about what makes a design resilient, how things change over years and across generations. You can make designs that last in this age, even when change is constant. 

[Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/) is a story about the foundations of the web and how we can leverage these foundations to build simpler web applications. This is the foundational text to htmx. 

[Build excellent websites](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/) is a short page about how we can build with methodologies and tools that are more adaptable.

[Grug Brain](https://grugbrain.dev/) One of my favorite essays on the internet. It's about keeping it simple! Like a caveman. 

[If not React than what?](https://infrequently.org/2024/11/if-not-react-then-what/) Answers to the age old question. There is a way, but it takes courage.
