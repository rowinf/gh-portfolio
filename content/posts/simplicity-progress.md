I was introduced to the idea of a [complexity budget](htmx.org/essays/complexity-budget) by the htmx author. The idea is that complexity is something you should try to limit during development to the most valuable things for what you're trying to build.

Some think [we can never build simple software](https://youtu.be/czzAVuVz7u4?si=HDiLILSN9BjS0lKT) because people have a natural tendency to increase complexity when things are "too simple" in the same way that [risk takers will always tolerate a certain amount of risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_compensation), and [work always fills up the alotted time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law) and [efficiency gains are offset by induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox). Complexity finds its way in, despite the best efforts of the most vigilant among us. To simply say "no" seems simple but maybe isn't.

> “Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.”

As a web developer I've seen plenty of teams get burned by their choice in technologies. The temptation for many is to become grug brained developers, claiming that this is a bad tradeoff every time. That adopting new things is bad and we should keep it as simple as everyone can agree to keep it.

Complexity always finds its way in though. When we're comfortable or we want to push things a bit further, we try the new framework, the new language, the new abstraction, the new multiplatform promise.

In my personal projects, my complexity budget is very low. I keep it low intentionally because I have control and I can do what I want. Furthermore, I'm trying something out. So I don't try anything else.

In a larger team, it's not possible to keep the complexity out because that's a different dynamic. It's subject to cultural influences and leadership's discretion. A grug brained leader can be very unpopular when the cultural forces egg us on to let the complexity in. My read on the culture is that this is starting to turn around, that it's time for a correction.

There's no solution to this problem, ultimately, the culture leans towards progress at the moment, but luddism is seeing a comeback. It could be that frameworks just aren't that interesting anymore. AI is eclipsing the latest JS frameworks in terms of attention. I think htmx is a "good enough" solution to most people's UX concerns most of the time. [The unexpected popularity of htmx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu9694zqpWA) is evidence that web development is coming back to its senses.

With the release of React 19, many of the problems caused by React are now solved by ... React. As popular as React once was, it is now clearly [less popular](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42331207).
