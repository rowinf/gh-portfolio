Front end mentor is a website for front end developers to improve their skills. It has some free challenges to test your skills on. 

Kevin Powell is a prominent CSS youtuber. He has many courses, one of which is a free walkthrough of one of these front end mentor challenges.

I did the front end mentor challenge with the help of Kevin Powell's walkthrough. He uses a platform called scrimba that combines video streaming with code editing in one awesome learning experience.

The challenge is to build a fictitious space travel website based on a figma design provided by front end mentor. The design has responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, and wide screen. It has fluid font sizes, responsive background images, and interactive gallery components.

I built it using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and a small JavaScript library called [surreal](https://github.com/gnat/surreal).

Hugo comes with Sass baked in. I used Sass for its utility to add alpha to a given color. Hugo comes prebuilt with Sass in the snap package binary, so switching from vanilla CSS to Sass was quite easy, there is so much functionality built into Hugo.

One issue that I think static site generators like Hugo could use is better JavaScript management. Surreal lets you write js inline with your html in `<script>` tags, saving you the effort of managing js in some other file. I highly recommend it for adding a bit of js to a static website.

The Kevin Powell walkthrough is a master class in CSS variables, utility classes, grid, flexbox, and media queries. I highly recommend his course material for learning modern CSS. 

Here is a link to the website in action.
