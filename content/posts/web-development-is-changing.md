React dominated the past decade. It was allowed to for many reasons, among them were cheap money and millenials like me entering the developer market. React now has first-class support for server side rendering with React 19. To take advantage of this new age of React, it is recommended in the developer documentation to use it with a framework like Remix or Next. It's still possible to use React by itself, but this is the age of the full-stack react application.

Tailwind CSS is very popular now, as developers struggle with CSS and the associated methodologies. The struggle is real, and Tailwind solved what I'm calling the "paradigm mismatch" between the component model of web development and global CSS. Tailwind brings CSS into the component model. Adding Tailwind to a project nowadays is pretty easy, since many are already using a build tool like Vite or esbuild. There are alternatives to Tailwind CSS, like tachyons, shed. 

Class-less CSS is becoming popular with Simple.css Pico.css and Matcha.css. I've had good experience with using class-less CSS in smaller projects. However, the industry is firmly in the age of utility class CSS.

CSS component generators like shadcn and css-zero are arriving.

open props is one that simply provides properties. Most people will want the full CSS experience however. I could see Open Props serving as a foundation for other libraries.

CSS has undergone rapid changes, it's been one of the more exiciting spaces to watch. It's possible that Layers and Scoped CSS can be game changers in the CSS space.

Some developers are unhappy with the complexity creep of web development. 

A library like htmx can change the future of web development. Some little websites are popping up around how to build differently using htmx [aha stack](https://ahastack.dev/) and of course books are being written about it. Htmx is low level, easy to adopt, easy to use, refreshing addition to an industry overwhelmed with complexity. Newcomers will enjoy the simpler approach htmx offers. It doesn't work well with React, however, which will slow its rate of adoption.

It has some adoption among independents and academics (the htmx creator is a college professor), but I think most people will not give up React, they want something that does a little more.

A new one: mizu.js has my curiosity because it works on the client as well as the server. It has a similar feel to htmx and alpine.js.

## Spoiled for Choice

Walking the line between stodgy and shiny is your challenge. Web developers are spoiled for choice, and it's hard to settle down on something long enough to be productive.

## Recent advancements

There has been many recent advancements in web development frameworks which coincided with the release of AI services and rising interest rates.

## Post-react world?

A lot of the web development industry is heavily invested in React and related technologies. As interest in React wanes according to the state of js survey, time will tell if React will remain the most used framework to develop new projects. My feeling is that React is too complex for most projects I am not interested in proving this, but I am only interested in the alternatives which seem great, but not quite good enough to get widespread adoption to replace React. 

It might be that React is not replaced, but as the appeal of other options are more appealing, interest will decline, and the next shiny thing will slowly gain popularity with the next generation of web developers. React developers will dominate for the foreseeable future.

However, React is an expensive way to build a website. To build with React, you need a highly trained web developer who has specialized in JavaScript and front end development. This web developer can likely build a nice front end, but there are many other skills needed to get a web application into production and to operate it: Back end development, cloud hosting, devops, quality assurance, test automation. 

Front end consists of using CSS, building components, synchronizing the state of the application in the browser with the server.

What we are seeing in the market is that developers are taking on additional responsibilities. So a front end developer also now probably needs some back end and cloud knowledge to be profitable for the employer.

The skills developers need now keep growing. This includes React, the associated ecosystem, web components, CSS, Tailwind, performance, accessibility, and all the additional responsibilities being taken on now.

I can see a possible future where the skills needed to be a developer are simply too much for new developers if the standards don't keep up. The market is shrinking, more demanding, while pay is bifurcating (a few get paid a lot, while others get flat or declining pay). The quality of the software is decreasing as well. Experienced developers are barely hanging on, while new developers are almost totally shut out. It's easy to see where this will go without a change of course.
